      <h4>Prime Minster Of India  </h4>
      <p>
      Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Bihari also spelled <strong>Behari</strong> , (born
      December 25, 1924, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India—died August 16, 2018,
      New Delhi, Delhi), leader of the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
      and twice prime minister of India (1996; 1998–2004). Vajpayee was first
      elected to parliament in 1957 as a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh
      (BJS), a forerunner of the BJP. In 1977 the BJS joined three other parties
      to form the Janata Party, which led a government that lasted until July
      1979. As foreign minister in the Janata government, Vajpayee earned a
      reputation for improving relations with Pakistan and China. In 1980,
      following a split in the Janata Party, Vajpayee helped the BJS to
      reorganize itself as the BJP. In 1992 he was one of the few Hindu leaders
      to speak out against the destruction of the historic mosque at Ayodhya by
      anti-Muslim extremists.
   
 
  
     
        Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister in May 1996 but was in office
        only 13 days, after failing to attract support from other parties. In
        early 1998 he again became prime minister, in elections in which the BJP
        won a record number of seats, but he was forced to make a shaky alliance
        with regional parties. In 1999 the BJP increased its seats in parliament
        and consolidated its hold on government. Although considered a
        pragmatist, Vajpayee assumed a defiant posture in the face of Western
        criticism of India’s testing of several nuclear weapons in 1998. He had
        earlier been praised for his conciliatory gestures toward India’s Muslim
        minority. In 2000 his government began an extensive program of
        divestment of public funds from several key state-run industries. In
        2002 Vajpayee’s government was criticized for its slowness in reacting
        to riots in Gujarat in which some 1,000 people (primarily Muslims) died.
        Nevertheless, in 2003 Vajpayee made a concerted effort to resolve
        India’s long-running feud with Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Under
        his leadership, India achieved steady economic growth, and the country
        became a world leader in information technology, though the poorer
        elements of Indian society often felt left out of the economic
        prosperity. In 2004 his coalition was defeated in the parliamentary
        election, and he resigned from office. Vajpayee announced his retirement
        from politics at the end of 2005. In late December 2014 he was awarded
        the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour.
